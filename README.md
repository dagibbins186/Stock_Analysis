# Stock_Analysis
**Project Background**
A client sought insights into green-energy-investing. This project examines the stocks' performance over time. At the press of a button, cacluations of the daily volume and the return of stocks run. This macro prevents cumbersome calcuations and human error.
**Results**
Upon opening the worksheet, the client is prompted to run an analysis.

When the client clicks the button, a prompt appears.

If the client enters 2017, then a table appears with this year's results.

The results show a fruitful year for green energy. Positive returns appear in green. Negative returns display in red. Among the stocks that the client watches, 11/12 turned a profit. The DQ stock did the best at (199%). They story changes if the client clears the worksheet, and enters 2018 to arrive at results.
![2018_Analysis_Results](https://github.com/dagibbins186/Stock_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/2018_Analysis_Results.png) In 2018, only 2/12 green stocks showed positive returns: ENPH and RUN. ENPH and RUN also performed well in 2017. Their consistency over time suggests they may be better investments than other green stocks in this portfolio.
